Hi, I'm Melanie Baker,

I tried coding for fun whilst running my gardening business and quickly discovered I was in the wrong career. I have since taught myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM. I am looking to further my skills, with the aim of finding employment within the industry (UK - London/SE England - I can be contacted at: baker_mel@hotmail.com).

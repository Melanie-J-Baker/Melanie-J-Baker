Hi, I'm Mel Baker,

I tried coding for fun whilst running my gardening business and quickly discovered I was in the wrong career. I have since taught myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, Amazon Web Services and Terraform. I have recently acquired the Amazon Web Services Certified Cloud Practitioner Certificate and have taught myself to provision and configure infrastructure using Terraform. I love building fullstack apps that solve real life problems and am continuing to further my skills, with the aim of finding employment within the industry (UK - London/SE England - I can be contacted at: baker_mel@hotmail.com).

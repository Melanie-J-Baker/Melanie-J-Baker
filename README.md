Hi, I'm Melanie Baker,

I am a self-employed gardener looking to escape the elements and change to a career in programming. 
I have spent the last year teaching myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript alongside running my business. 
I have very much enjoyed learning to code, and am now looking to further my skills, with the aim of finding employment within the industry.

So far I have completed the following online courses:

The Odin Project:
- Foundations (Introduction to Web Development)
- Intermediate HTML and CSS
- Intermediate Fullstack JavaScript (Current)

freeCodeCamp:
- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
